For this assignment, we merged two dataframes that included testing data on mice for Skin Cancer treating drugs.  I manipulated the data per the assignment directions and created graphs and visualizations to help illustrate the story the data is showing us.

As a broad view of the ten drugs used in the study, Capomulin and Ramicane seemed to provide the best results since they had the lowest mean, median and variance for the tumor volumes of the mice who were treated with those drugs compared to the eight other drugs.  It should be noted that those two drugs had higher number of observed timepoints compared to the other 8 drugs, which may have influenced the results.  The other 8 drugs produced relatively similiar mean and median tumor volumes, although Ketapril and Naftisol had the highest variance in their results.  
The study was done basically on half male and half female mice.  
One mouse, with ID l509, did see it's tumor Volume reduced from 45 mm3 down to 41 mm3 over the 45 day timeperiod.
